# Scrape_some_details_from_Flipkart

Web data extraction (also known as web scraping, web harvesting, screen scraping, etc.) is a technique for extracting huge amounts of data from websites on the internet.
The data available on websites is generally not available to download easily and can only be accessed by using a web browser. However,
web is the largest repository of open data and this data has been growing at exponential rates since the inception of internet.

Web data is of great use to Ecommerce portals, media companies, research firms, data scientists, government and can even help the
healthcare industry with ongoing research and making predictions on the spread of diseases.

Web scraping helps you do this in an automated fashion and does it far more efficiently and accurately. A web scraping setup interacts with websites in a way similar to a
web browser, but instead of displaying it on a screen, it saves the data to a storage system.
